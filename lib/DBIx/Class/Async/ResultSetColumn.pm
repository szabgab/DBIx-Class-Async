=head1 NAME

DBIx::Class::Async::ResultSetColumn - Asynchronous operations on a single ResultSource column

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.50

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $rs = $schema->resultset('Invoice')->search({ status => 'unpaid' });
    my $col = $rs->get_column('amount');

    # All methods return a Future
    $col->sum->then(sub {
        my $total = shift;
        say "Total unpaid: $total";
    });

    $col->max->on_done(sub {
        my $highest = shift;
        say "Highest unpaid invoice: $highest";
    });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A C<ResultSetColumn> object represents a specific column within a L<DBIx::Class::Async::ResultSet>.
It is used to perform aggregate operations (like summation or averaging) or to fetch
single-column data sets asynchronously.

This object is typically obtained by calling C<get_column> on a
L<DBIx::Class::Async::ResultSet> object.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 sum

Returns a L<Future> resolving to the sum of all values in the column.

=head2 max / min

Returns a L<Future> resolving to the maximum or minimum value in the column,
respectively.

=head2 avg / average

Returns a L<Future> resolving to the average (mean) value of the column.

=head2 count

Returns a L<Future> resolving to the count of values in the column.

=head1 INTERNAL METHODS

=head2 new

Instantiates a new column proxy. Requires C<resultset>, C<column>, and C<async_db>.

=head2 _aggregate

The core dispatcher that builds the worker payload. It extracts the current
search criteria from the parent ResultSet and appends the target column name
before calling the background worker.

sub new {
    my ($class, %args) = @_;
    return bless {
        _resultset => $args{resultset},
        _column    => $args{column},
        _async_db  => $args{async_db},
    }, $class;
}

sub sum     { shift->_aggregate('sum')     }
sub max     { shift->_aggregate('max')     }
sub min     { shift->_aggregate('min')     }
sub avg     { shift->_aggregate('avg')     }
sub count   { shift->_aggregate('count')   }
sub average { shift->_aggregate('average') }

sub _aggregate {
    my ($self, $func) = @_;
    my $db = $self->{_async_db};

    my $payload = $self->{_resultset}->_build_payload();

    $payload->{column} = $self->{_column};

    # We reuse the parent ResultSet's bridge and payload logic
    return DBIx::Class::Async::_call_worker(
        $db,
        $func,
        $payload,
    );
